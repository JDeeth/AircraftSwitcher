AircraftSwitcher
================

X-Plane plugin for switching aircraft quickly using commands.

This is the readme file for programmers compiling/building the project themselves. The user readme is in the ShippingCrate folder. This represents the environment that is zipped up and uploaded to the file archives, minus compiled files.

If you'd like to compile this project for Mac or Linux and let me upload the binary alongside mine at x-plane.org I'd be delighted!

The Windows compiled file exists here: http://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?app=downloads&showfile=16776

Hello,

This is Dozer's Aircraft Switcher, a plugin for quickly switching between up to eight aircraft. By using this package, you accept the disclaimer below. I hope you find this useful!

This plugin is all of four hours old at present and probably has rough edges. It is only compiled for Windows at present, but the source code is available on Github. If you'd like to compile this for Mac or Linux and include the file in this package, please let me know. The repository is here:

[Installation]
Put the files into your <X-Plane>/Resources/Plugins/folder. They should be located like this:
/Resources/Plugins/AircraftSwitcher/win.xpl
/Resources/Plugins/AircraftSwitcher.ini

Also, place the two .dll files in the "mingw dlls" folder into your root X-Plane directory, if they're not already there. They're needed because this plugin is compiled using mingw32-gcc and I haven't learned how static linking works yet. (mingwm10.dll and libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll .)

[Configuration]
Edit AircraftSwitcher.ini to use the paths of the aircraft you'd like to load.
The aircraft are loaded using these custom commands:
Dozer/AircraftSwitcher/load_aircraft_1 to _8

[Notes]
This plugin uses the XPLMSetUsersAircraft function from the SDK to load/reload an aircraft. It does not also reposition the aircraft on the nearest runway, unlike loading a new aircraft from the menu. So if you're flying at 350kts at 32,000ft in a 737 and switch to a glider, you'll find yourself in a glider doing 350kts at 32,000ft and very quickly losing a wing. Options to also reset to the runway, or to pass the speed as a ratio of Vne rather than an absolute value, could be added if people want it.

Generally, if XPLMSetUsersAircraft gets bad input, it will throw a useful error box (which often holds a hint as to why the input was bad) and give you the CirrusJet instead.

This plugin has been thrown together very quickly and NOT thoroughly tested. It seems to work on Windows XP and X-Plane 9.70 - I have no capacity to test any other combination of systems. Use it at your own risk!
